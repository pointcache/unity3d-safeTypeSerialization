# unity3d-safeTypeSerialization
Serialize type fields using ID attributes

## How to use

Add a ExposeTypeAttribute to every class that should be exposed to the type serializer and assign it a custom ID.

```cs
using pointcache.SerializedType;

[ExposeType ("weapon")]
public class Weapon {}
```

The ID makes sure that the serialization retains even if you change the type name or namespace as long as the id stays the same.

To get a reference to a type you use the SerializedType type.

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using pointcache.SerializedType;

public class WeaponAsset : ScriptableObject
{
  [SerializeField]
  public SerializedType WeaponType;
}
```

To access the type itself you can simply do something like this (because it has an implicit conversion to System.Type):

```cs
System.Activator.CreateInstance (WeaponType);
```
